### introduction
> This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.



# What You Will Build
- You will be building a multi-section landing page.
- Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API.
- To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page.
- We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally,
- dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding 
- the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.




### What will I learn?

> The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. 
> Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.





### what is languages used ?

> JavaScript and the DOM

- Great! You now have the starter code. Before moving forward, make sure you are comfortable with the content from the JavaScript and the DOM course. Ask yourself:

1. What is the Document?
2. What are events?
3. How do we listen for them?
4. How does event delegation help us avoid too many events?
5. Check Working with Browser Events in JavaScript and the DOM for a refresher if needed
6. How can we access elements with the following two methods? What are the differences between them?
> querySelector()
> querySelectorAll()
# How do you use getElementbyId() to select a DOM element by its id?
> We can also access elements with getElementsByClassName(). What does this method return, and how do you use it?
> How do you use the className property? What does it return, and why would it be useful?
> What are the different methods for classList?
# Hint: the add(), remove(), and toggle() methods look particularly useful...
> Every element has an innerHTML property that represents the markup of the element's content. How can you leverage this property to get and set content?



### The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:

- What’s the ideal workflow?
- How many files do I need?
- Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
- How many JavaScript functions do I need?
- Should my function be this many lines of code?
- Is readability or performance more important?



###Project Summary
< This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM.
< The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM,
< and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.
< This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

< For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. 
< You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. 
< If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible.
< As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.




### Architecture.

- he project should have a structure like the one shown below. 
- All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.


#css
- styles.css    

#index.html


#js
- app.js

< README.md


### Usability.

< All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers


### HTML Structure

< There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.




###God Luck.
